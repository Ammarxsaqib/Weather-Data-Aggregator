**-: Weather Data Retrieval: -**

**Introduction:**
Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the Weather Data Retrieval project tries to collect and provide current weather data for a specified area. Python and the requests module are used in the project to send HTTP requests to the API and retrieve relevant meteorological data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather.

**Task Components:**
1.	Code Application
At its core, the project is a Python script called project_weather.py that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API. Latitude, longitude, and an API key are accepted as input arguments by the script when it generates the API URL and sends a GET request to retrieve weather information.
2.	Project Establishment
The script cannot be executed until the user has obtained an API key from OpenWeatherMap. The API key (OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY) must be specified as an environment variable in order to allow parameterized and safe access.
Display of Information:
The script outputs weather information in a readable format, including temperature in Celsius, humidity percentage, wind speed in meters per second, and a brief description of the weather condition.

**Conclusion:**
A simple yet effective way to obtain up-to-date weather information for a specific location is through the Weather Data Retrieval Project. Dependable and accurate data are ensured while using the OpenWeatherMap API. Future developments could include user interactivity, historical data retrieval, and graphical presentation.
